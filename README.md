Welcome to FEDGEN CLOUD HPC
=============================================

The ` FEDGEN CLOUD HPC <https://toubkal.um6p.ma>`_ hosted at the `University Mohammed VI Polytechnic (UM6P) <https://um6p.ma>`_ is aimed at providing HPC services to the research communities in Morocco and the African continent.

This documentation covers the general activities most users will deal with when using the FEDGEN CLOUD HPC service. An HPC cluster is a set of computers connected via a high-performance network allowing them to operate as a single "supercomputer".

Thus, computing resources such as CPUs, memory and storage on a cluster are used and shared by many users to help them accelerate computations or analysis.
